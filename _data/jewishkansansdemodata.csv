js_001,Letter from Rose to Sara,Rose,1900,"The HLBS played a major role in tzedakah, performing social services and charitable giving. In addition to supporting the local charities through their dues and fundraising, the HLBS also donated to national organizations, including the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum, Denver hospitals, and the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. During the depression they assisted unhoused Jews passing through Topeka. They would provide meals, a place to sleep for a night, and a bus or train ticket to a major city-Kansas City or Denver—which had greater resources to provide assistance.",hbls;letters;tzedakah;kosher food,"Topeka, Kansas",39.05463134,-95.6720889,Dr. David Katzman and Sharyn Brooks Katzman,pg_9_12_01bl,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,image,/objects/demo_001.jpg,/objects/small/demo_001_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/demo_001_th.jpg,historic sepia photograph depicting a formal brick and stone building in the College Gothic style,

In their preface, they described the joy felt in sharing these recipes, as well as the difficulties associated with writing down specific directions. Often, their recipes were based on oral lessons, where a mother or grandmother would teach her daughters through verbal direction and practice. Many of the measurements were originally based on gut feeling, rather than exact measurements.",kosher food; cookbook,Lawrence Kansas,,,Dr. David Katzman and Sharyn Brooks Katzman,FirePump1,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,"Material produced by the United States Forest Service and is in Public Domain.
