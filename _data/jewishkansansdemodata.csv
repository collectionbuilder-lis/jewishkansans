In addition to supporting the local charities through their dues and fundraising, the HLBS also donated to national organizations, including the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum, Denver hospitals, and the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. During the depression they assisted unhoused Jews passing through Topeka. They would provide meals, a place to sleep for a night, and a bus or train ticket to a major city-Kansas City or Denver—which had greater resources to provide assistance.",hbls;letters;tzedakah;kosher food,"Topeka, Kansas",39.05463134,-95.6720889,David and Sharyn Brooks Katzman,pg_9_12_01bl,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,image,/objects/demo_001.jpg,/objects/small/demo_001_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/demo_001_th.jpg,historic sepia photograph depicting a formal brick and stone building in the College Gothic style,

A organ plays dramatic intro music, then continues quietly behind speaker voice]

[Dramatic male speaking voice]:

As an army terrible with batters sweeping before it the black shades of night, routing despair, comes the flaming truth of the God law.

Why do you suffer the indignities of life, when you can control life? Your fate is in your hands now, for at last, the way is open, if you will but take it. 
When Dr. Frank B Robinson first realized the dynamic implications of Psychiana, he was in debt, a humble drug clerk with no future, no hope. Now he possesses all that he wants of wealth, his mind is at peace, and he is accorded praise and renown as an outstanding and famous psychologist. The same forces that raised him out of the depths, to stand on a high plane among men, can be put to work for you."
