<h1>The Evolution of Kosher Foodways in Kansas</h1>
<p>
  Because of the relative isolation of Kansas (and the midwest more generally), accessing kosher food sometimes presented a challenge to Jewish Kansans. This was particularly true in the smallest and most rural communities.

## Cookbooks 
  <p>Daily practices, such as preparing food, can hold significance as pathways to maintaining personal and cultural identity. Recipes are one way that older generations pass stories and traditions on to their descendants.</p>

  <h3>Joy of Jewish Cooking Cookbook</h3>
  <p>In 1969, 19 Jewish women prepared a local cookbook and printed it at the World Company Printers in Lawrence. In their preface, they described the joy felt in sharing these recipes, as well as the difficulties associated with writing down specific directions. Often, their recipes were based on oral lessons, where a mother or grandmother would teach her daughters through verbal direction and practice. Many of the measurements were originally based on gut feeling, rather than exact measurements.</p>

## Grocers

<h3>Epstein's Kosher Market</h3>
  <p>In the 1970s, Epstein's-butcher, grocery, bakery
    â€”was the last surviving kosher market in the metro Kansas City area, once populated by a score of kosher stores. Epstein's originally opened in the 1930s on 18th Street in Kansas City, before moving south in 1968. Sam Epstein took over the business when his father fell ill in the 1940s. Sam Epstein and his wife Gertrude ran it until the late 1980s. This form enabled Epstein's to order adequate Passover supplies and ensured that families in the surrounding region had proper food access for Passover.

    <h3>Jacobson's Strictly Kosher Foods</h3>
      <p>After Epstein's Kosher butcher closed in the late 1980s, Les and Harvey Jacobson, who had owned a non-kosher grocery store, responded to the community's needs by opening Jacobson's Strictly Kosher Foods in 1990. They hired Roosevelt Bacon, Jr., who had worked at Epstein's as a butcher for more than 40 years. In 2000 Irv's Kosher Foods opened, and Jacobson sold out to the new kosher market a year later.</p>

    <h3>Lawrence Sanitary Milk Company</h3>
    <p>The Lawrence Sanitary Milk Co. was a Jewish-owned dairy from 1920 until 1959, when it was purchased by the Milk Producers Marketing Co. (All Star Dairy). The founders, brothers Simon and Samuel Hurwitz left Russia in 1912, joining their elder brother Max on his small dairy farm in Topeka. After serving in WWl, Simon and Samuel moved to Lawrence, opening the Lawrence Sanitary Milk and Ice Cream Co. In the 1930s Sam left the firm, entering the wholesale grocery and produce business as Food Supply, Inc.</p>
