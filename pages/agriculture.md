## Jewish Agricultural Colonies
Jewish agricultural colonies are a third of the well-known and researched aspects of Kansas
Jewish history. Russian Jews arrived in the 1880s as part of a larger “back to the land” movement, and Jewish emigrant societies helped Jews on farms in around 70 agricultural colonies across the United States. Eight of these colonies were in Western Kansas, and while all of them failed within a few years of their establishment, the colonies formed the vanguard of Eastern European Jewish immigration to Kansas.
