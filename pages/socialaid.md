# Women-Led Social Aid Organizations 

From the members of the Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society and the local chapter of the National Council for Jewish Women, to the current participants in the Lawrence Jewish Community Congregation, local Jewish women have played an integral role in creating supportive and welcoming Jewish communities. The often unseen labor of these women has been essential to creating Jewish community in the isolated setting of the Midwest.

## Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society

The Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society was a social aid organization in Topeka, Kansas. Founded in 1885 by a group of German-speaking women, the Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society (HBLS) admitted new Eastern European women moving to Topeka after the turn of the century. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the society provided community charitable services. Participation faded at the end of the 1930s.

The HLBS played a major role in tzedakah (the Hebrew word for justice and charity), performing social services and charitable giving. During the depression they assisted transient Jews passing through Topeka. They would provide meals, a place to sleep for a night, and a bus or train ticket to a major city—Kansas City or Denver—which had greater resources to provide assistance.

The women arranged charge accounts with restaurants, hotels and transportation lines. The slips here represent meals provided; the restaurants billed the HLBS for payment. Most Jewish Topekan women worked for wages downtown, often in their family businesses, so they were physically present to help. In most towns Jewish male merchants provided these daily services.

In addition to supporting the local charities through their dues and fundraising, the HLBS also donated to national organizations, including the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum, Denver hospitals, and the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.
