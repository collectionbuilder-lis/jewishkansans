In response to the massive immigration waves between 1880 and 1920, Jewish charitable
organizations mostly on the east coast, cooperated to disperse Eastern European Jews across
the interior United States. European and U.S. Jewish organizations encouraged and sponsored
Jewish resettlement from larger cities to rural areas, where immigrants would be more likely to
become Americanized by learning English and U.S. culture and customs. Emigrant societies
educated them about places in the interior and provided some financial or material support for
transportation. Hoping to alleviate the problems of Eastern European immigrants and to help
destitute Jews in Russia emigrate to the United States, an early one of several projects was to
establish Jewish agricultural colonies in the country’s interior

# Agricultural Colonies 
### 1880s
Jewish agricultural colonies are a third of the well-known and researched aspects of Kansas
Jewish history. Russian Jews arrived in the 1880s as part of a larger “back to the land” movement, and Jewish emigrant societies helped Jews on farms in around 70 agricultural colonies across the United States. Eight of these colonies were in Western Kansas, and while all of them failed within a few years of their establishment, the colonies formed the vanguard of Eastern European Jewish immigration to Kansas.

# Industrial Removal Office
### 1902-1922
Between 1901 and 1922, the Industrial Removal Office distributed approximately 79,000 Jewish
immigrants from overcrowded quarters on the East Coast to about 1,500 communities throughout
the United States and Canada. The I.R.O. matched applicants in New York with Jewish
communities across the country that offered employment in the country’s interior. About 40
communities in Kansas took in small numbers of placements. Most went to the Missouri side of
Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka.


# The Galveston Movement
### 1907-1914
In 1907, the IRO founded the Jewish Immigration Information Bureau (JIIB) to manage the
Galveston Plan, which included several philanthropic organizations, both national and
international. Between 1907 and 1914, the plan steered 10,000 immigrants through the Galveston
port of entry. Most left Eastern Europe through Bremen for Galveston, then directed to
communities in central and southwestern United States. The plan ended before it reached its
goals. Metro-area Kansas City was the single largest destination
