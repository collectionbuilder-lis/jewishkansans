## 1902-1922
The Industrial Removal Office (IRO) was dedicated to placing new immigrants (some with families) in Midwestern towns. Many American-born Jews believed that the concentration of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in East Coast cities were causing a rise in antisemitism.  One response was to disperse Jews to the heartland. (The Galveston Plan (1907-1914) was similarly motivated.) Agents traveled to Midwestern towns to arrange and to pressure local Jewish merchants and institutions to sponsor new immigrants. In Topeka the HLBS worked with the IRO to find jobs and help settle in immigrants, most of whom were native Yiddish-speakers but often with limited English. These documents reflect those activities; Yiddish documents were essential for the immigrants. Most Topekan arrivals found jobs in the Santa Fe Railroad shops.
