## Early Jewish Lawrence 
Though Jews have been a present in Lawrence since its settlement in the 1850s, no formal congregation existed until after World War II.  The community incorporated in 1869 to inherit the Eudora Jewish cemetery—Bene Israel—but the German-speaking merchant community failed to act on that.  In the last two decades of the 19th century Jewish residents organized a short-lived Sunday school, a number of social organizations, and a section (chapter) of the National Council of Jewish Women. In the 1930s a group of women organized the Lawrence Community Women which, until its demise in this century, was the longest serving Jewish institution in Lawrence.

## Forming a Formal Congregation

What spurred the organization of the LJCC in the 1940s was the increase in Jewish university students and the hiring of Jewish faculty, and the growing number of Jewish children. A few families started Sunday school classes, which led to the organization of the LJCC and acquisition of a house near campus to host Hebrew and Sunday school classes, social activities, occasional services and the newly formed Hillel chapter. Christian groups in town contributed to the fundraising for the house. When the LJCC sold that Tennessee Street house, erecting a modest building at its current site, a majority of contributors came from the university rather than the town. 

The Lawrence Jewish Community Congregation built and occupied their current building in 1962,  Soon after, in 1965, they began the Blintz Brunch, which has become a Lawrence institution. Now held in November, on the Sunday before election day, it serves as the major community fundraiser for the congregation, as a way of engaging the larger community and presenting aspects of Jewish life, especially blintzes and bagels and lox spread as well as selling challah, rye breads, kosher salamis, babkas, and baked goods made by congregation members. In addition, it brings together nearly all Jews in town, not just congregants, who work preparing for and on the day of the blintz brunch.

## Connecting through the Written Word

The monthly newsletter (printed and internet) is, for the LJCC and most Jewish congregations and social institutions the primary tool of organizational communications. Presidents write a monthly column, the newsletter records past activities and future events, reports on member activities as well as individual and institutional news.

The LJCC attempts to serve as an umbrella community for all Jews. For services it has an array of sets of siddurim (prayer books) that could allow nearly any minhag. The unaffiliated congregation has sets of conservative, reconstruction and multiple reform prayer books which attests to its nondenominational identity.
