# August Bondi

August Bondi is the most well-known figure in Kansas Jewish history for participating in the
Battles of Black Jack and Osawatomie alongside abolitionist John Brown in 1856. The year was
crucial as Brown gained national notoriety after Brown’s men murdered 5 pro-slavery settlers in
the Pottawatomie Massace. Often identified with John Brown’s abolitionism, Bondi was among the
more common free staters who opposed the extension of slavery to Kansas yet rejected Brown’s
advocacy of equal rights for Blacks. Bondi did not participate in any of Brown’s battles outside of the state.

As a first-person witness, Bondi weighed in on a national debate in the early 1880s about the
political atmosphere in Bleeding Kansas, justifying the Massacre as a necessary blow to the pro-slavery faction’s confidence and violence. John Brown scholars have frequently used Bondi’s
narratives to reconstruct Brown’s actions and frame of mind. Scholars of the 1848 uprising,
Jewish history in the Civil War also draw from Bondi’s writings. Bondi features prominently in
Jewish American history and the history of Kansas.
